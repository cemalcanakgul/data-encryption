## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability. It's important to give detailed instructions on how they can privately communicate with you. Emphasize how important it is to not publicly disclose the vulnerability before it is fixed.

Please follow the steps below to report a security vulnerability:

1. Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.
2. Instead, please email us directly at [@cemalcanakgul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cemalcanakgul).
3. Provide a clear and comprehensive description of the issue, including possible impact and potential exploits.
4. Allow us a reasonable amount of time to respond to the issue before any public disclosure.

### Security Update Policy

We will assess each vulnerability report and respond as quickly as possible. Hereâ€™s what you can expect from us:

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report.
- We will provide an estimated time frame for addressing the vulnerability.
- We will notify you when the vulnerability has been fixed and the details are made public.

We appreciate your help in keeping our project safe and secure.
