# Contributing to the Data Encryption Project

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, track issues, and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT License You Agree to

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same MIT License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/cemalcanakgul/data-encryption/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/cemalcanakgul/data-encryption/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give a sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* You can use an editor like [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to automatically format your code.
* Please keep your code in compliance with any project-specific style guidelines.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.

## References

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format for your pull request title: `[Feature]: [Short Feature Description]`
- Use the `[Draft]` prefix in your pull request title if it's a work in progress.

Thank you for contributing to the Data Encryption Project!
